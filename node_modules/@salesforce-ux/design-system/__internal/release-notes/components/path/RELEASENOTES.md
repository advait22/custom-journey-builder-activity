# Path Release Notes

<!-- ## [Unreleased] -->

## 2.8.0

### Changed

- Increased font size to 14px, applied bold font weight, and removed uppercase styling in `slds-path__coach-title`.

## 2.7.0

### Added

- Added `slds-path_has-coaching` hook on the `slds-path` container element, to add support for spacing differences between coaching and non-coaching.

### Changed

- Modified the appearance of the Path container.
- Revised the colors used on the active and curent Path steps, introducing support for borders.
- Replaced spacing tokens with variable spacing tokens to respond to a user's densification setting.
- Changed the direction of the coaching arrow to point to the right / down, instead of up / down. To take advantage of this change, remove the `slds-flip_vertical` class on the open state for `slds-path__trigger`, and instead use our new class `slds-path__trigger_open` to set the direction of the open state on the button arrow.

### Fixed

- Fixed text centering issue with first and last Path steps
- Fixed rotation transition on Path coaching toggle button
