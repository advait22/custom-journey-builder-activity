/**
 * #### Accessibility
 *
 * Notifications should contain `role="status"` on the container to signal to
 * assistive technology that they require the userâ€™s attention. Historically the role of `alert` would be used,
 * but because you can invoke multiple toasts, assertive alerts would override previous toasts in the screen
 * reader's speech queue. Role of `status` is a polite live region, which does not clear the queue, reducing the risk
 * of a toast message being missed.
 *
 * Use a span with `slds-assistive-text` to let the user know what type of notification it is.
 *
 * @summary Toast serves as a feedback & confirmation mechanism after the user takes an action.
 *
 * @base
 * @name toast
 * @selector .slds-notify_container
 * @support dev-ready
 * @category base
 * @type messaging
 * @role alert
 * @layout responsive
